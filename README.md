Collector agent
--------
The Bliss Collector is a Ruby command-line application to collect repository and commit data for Bliss.ai.

Information Required
--------
You will need the following information before using Bliss's Collector:
*  Your Bliss API Key - You can find this by logging into bliss.ai, clicking on the Settings wheel, scrolling the the bottom and clicking "Show" on the API Key bar
*  The path of the directory where all of your repositories are located
*  Your git organization name

To Clone This Repository
--------
Make sure you have Git installed on your machine.

For Ubuntu/Debian machines, execute the following in terminal:
`````````
sudo apt-get install git
`````````

For RPM-based systems such as Yum, execute the following in terminal:
`````````
sudo yum install -y git
`````````

For Windows machines, you will need to download and run the installer at:
https://git-scm.com/download/win

You can then clone the repository by executing the following in your terminal:
```````````
git clone https://github.com/founderbliss/collector.git
```````````

Dependencies
--------
Bliss's Collector has specific requirements that need to be met before it will work on all project types.
We attempt to install these for you with the installscripts as outlined below, however additional steps
may be required depending on your specific environment and it's compatibility with our scripts.

The following is a list of dependencies that are required to support:
*  JRuby 9.0.3.0
*  Ruby DevKit
*  Perl
*  Python
*  NodeJS and Node Package Manager
*  php
*  Git installation

In addition, a number of linting tools are required:
*  JSHint (for JavaScript repositories)
*  Prospector (for Python/Django repositories)
*  ReSharper and InspectCode (for .NET repositories)
*  pmd (for Java repositories)
*  cpd - included with pmd (for all repositories)
*  lizard (for Objective-C repositories)
*  metric_fu (for ruby repositories)
*  PHP Codesniffer (for php repositories)
*  Wordpress Codesniffer (for Wordpress repositories)
*  csslint (for css file linting)

For those with .NET repositories, you will need to manually install InspectCode, which is a code inspection tool for .NET projects. You download it here:

  https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/command-line.html

Getting Started With Unix (CentOS/Ubuntu)
--------
There is a shell script in the 'installscripts' that will handle the installation of dependencies.
To run this script, open up a terminal window, navigate (cd) into the 'installscripts' directory, and type
`````
sh linux.sh
`````

You will need to reboot your system after running this script.

After running this script and rebooting, you will need to navigate (cd) into the Collector directory and type:
```````````
gem install bundler
bundle install
```````````

Getting Started With Windows
--------

There is a script called setup.ps1 in the 'installscripts' folder that will manage the installation of Java, JRuby, Chocolatey Nuget, Perl, Python, NodeJS and NPM.

To run this script, open up a Powershell window (as an Administrator), navigate (cd) into the 'installscripts' directory, and type:
````
powershell.exe setup.ps1
````
This will begin the installation process.

Note: If running scripts is disabled on your machine, make sure to set the  '-ExecutionPolicy ByPass' option when executing the above command.

Detailed instructions on how to install PHP in Windows can be found here:

http://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-install-php-on-windows/

You can also use Chocolatey to install PHP, however you will need to add 'C:\tools\php' to your path as this is not done automatically. Instructions on altering your path can be found here:

http://windowsitpro.com/systems-management/how-can-i-add-new-folder-my-system-path

After running this script and rebooting, you will need to navigate (cd) into the Collector directory and type:
```````````
gem install bundler
bundle install
```````````

Usage
--------
#### Unix ####
To run our Bliss CLI, navigate (cd) to the Collector directory in a shell, and type:
`````
ruby blisscollector.rb
`````

#### Windows ####
To run the CLI, navigate (cd) to the Collector directory in a shell, and type:
`````
jruby blisscollector.rb
`````

#### Configuration ####

The first time you do this, you will be prompted for the information set out in the 'Information Required' section above.
This information will be stored in a YAML file, bliss-config.yml, in the home folder for future use. You can remove any of these entries to be prompted again, or you can updated the information stored in the config file.

The commands available through the CLI tool are:
*  Collector (C) - this command will collect metadata about your repositories and post them to Bliss
*  Stats (S) - this command will log all of your commits with Bliss, and calculate data such as Lines of Code, Test Lines of Code etc.
*  Linter (L) - this command will run linters over all of your outstanding commits and send the linting data to Bliss for analysis

These should be run in the following order:

Collector -> Stats -> Linter

Task scheduling (Unix)
----------------------
Bliss Collector uses the 'whenever' gem to manage cron scheduling. To set the task to run on a regular basis, open 'config/schedule.rb'. There is an existing task in the file that will run Collector, Stats and Linter in order. Just change the '1.minutes' to whatever interval you wish the job to run at, update your crontab by typing
`bundle exec whenever --update-crontab`
into your terminal from the collector directory.

To stop scheduled tasks, just type
`bundle exec whenever -c`
into your terminal from the collector directory.

Task scheduling (Windows)
-------------------------
Windows users can schedule the collector to run every three hours by running the collector with an optional argument:

````````````````````````````````
jruby blisscollector.rb schedule
````````````````````````````````

Notes
-----
*  You will need to make sure that the machine the Collector runs on has the appropriate SSH keys setup, so that the application can 'git pull' without being prompted for a username/password combination.

Issues
--------
Issues are reported via github "Issues":

https://github.com/founderbliss/collector/issues

To start working on an issue, take one that you can handle from the issue list. Assign it to yourself and start to work on it. Please close issues before taking new ones.

Commit guidelines
--------

Please include the issue number in the commit preceded by the hash (#) character (see https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation). This does not need to follow a 'fixes' or 'closed' but just include
it so that we can see what commits are for which issues.

You must keep your diffs down the the minimum. Do not add extra spaces or remove extra spaces on lines that you do not need to change. Also, keep the tab set as two spaces and not reformat the code unless you are changing it. If your IDE reformats code, please disable this feature so that only the minimum diff is committed to keep the issue clean and self contained. We code review almost every commit so if the diffs are bigger than they need to be, we will be spending time looking into lines that just contain space changes which takes extra time and therefore money.

Don't break the build
--------

If you are working on a long change, you can commit locally but do not push until you have the tests passing. If you push code with broken tests, this will break our continuous build and send alerts to our team.

Each party agrees that all press releases, announcements or other forms of publicity made by such party concerning any joint activity or business relationship between the parties must be pre-approved in writing by the other party.
Non-waiver.  Any failure by the Disclosing Party to enforce the Receiving Party’s strict performance, or any waiver by the Disclosing Party, of any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of the Disclosing Party’s right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement.
No License.
